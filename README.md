Hey, I'm Ryan DuCharme and I started gaining interest in programming when I was in middle school (2010). Through out the years I have been learning on and off.
Over the past 2 years I have been getting more involved with it. I am currently trying to hone my craft to become a full time developer. 
Right now I'm learning a lot of C# by coding small projectst for my current line of work, or just personal projects. I am at an intermediate level in web programming
and feel pretty comofrtable with Javascript. 
I would like to start learning more low level languages like C and C++ to get a deeper understanding about the inner workings of the Windows OS, and how it is communicating
with the hardware of the machine.
